  Abstract                 = {In this thesis we present a methodology for validating Gaussian process models: Gaussian process emulators and simulator discrepancy models. A Gaussian process emulator is a representation of our beliefs about a mathematical model implemented in a computer program known as a simulator. By ``simulator discrepancy'', we mean the difference between a simulator's output and the corresponding physical process. We present a set of diagnostics to validate and assess the adequacy of Gaussian process models. These diagnostics are based on comparisons between real observations and model predictions for some test data, known as validation data, defined by a sample of real observations not used to build the model. The validation data are chosen according to designs that we have developed for such purposes. The diagnostics for Gaussian process emulators and discrepancy models are useful tools during the modelling procedure. Based on the result of the diagnostics, we can identify problems such as underconfidence, overconfidence, poor estimation of some unknown parameters, which if not identified might compromise analyses using the Gaussian process models. After we identify a problem, the diagnostics may provide information on where we should collect more data in order to make the predictive model a better representation of our beliefs.},

Dynamic models can be used to cope with the variations of the effects and spatial components are introduced to handle spatial variation. This paper proposes a methodology to simultaneously introduce these components into the model. A number of specifications for the spatial components are considered. Estimation is performed via a Bayesian approach through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Models are compared to assess relevance of their components. Analysis of a real data set is performed, showing the relevance of both time-varying covariate effects and spatial components. Extensions to the methodology are proposed along with concluding remarks.},

We implement the direct ap-proach to estimate the PR from binary regression models based on two methods proposed by Wil-cosky {\&} Chambless and compare with different methods. We used three examples and compared the crude and adjusted estimate of PR, with the estimates obtained by use of log-binomial, Pois-son regression and the prevalence odds ratio (POR). PRs obtained from the direct approach resulted in values close enough to those obtained by log-binomial and Poisson, while the POR overestimated the PR. The model implemented here showed the following advantages: no nu-merical instability; assumes adequate probabil-ity distribution and, is available through the R statistical package.},

The strength factor is a measure of discrimination among the national teams obtained from their memberships to fuzzy clusters. The clusters are obtained with the use of the Fuzzy C-means algorithm applied to a vector of variables, most of them available on the official FIFA website.

Attention to research in the pediatric age bracket in 30 years of the epidemic is explained by the age group's immunological characteristics, since AIDS progresses faster in children than in adults. Recent studies focus on the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy before the onset of symptoms. Early introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy has been implemented effectively and safely in populations with limited resources, leading to significantly improved survival. The current challenge is to manage a chronic disease with acute complications. New studies should focus on population specificities and identify the individual needs of pediatric patients.},

Aims: To assess the hospital structure for birth care in Brazil and analyze hospital adequacy to care for newborns according to levels of risk. Methods: Data were collected as part of a nationwide hospital-based cohort study, 'Birth in Brazil'. The hospitals were classified according to whether they had a neonatal intensive care unit and divided into two models of governance: public and private financing. Three structure domains were assessed: human resources, medications and equipment for post-natal women and newborn emergency care. Newborns were classified according to the obstetric risk. Results: There are more NICUs in private hospitals and they cater mostly for low obstetric risk newborns; the public sector serves 50{\%} of at-risk patients in hospitals without an NICU. The differences between hospital service structures according to geographic region and capital/inland cities were evident. Hospitals in less developed regions and inland cities had poorer adequacy in the three domains. Conclusion: The distribution of neonatal care to Brazilian infants varied between the public and private sectors. The public sector offered less complex services for newborns at risk, and infants without obstetric risk were born in facilities with an NICU, creating the possibility of unnecessary intervention, especially in the private sector.},

  Abstract                 = {Deterministic mathematical models play an important role in our under-standing of population growth dynamics. In particular, the effect of temperature on the growth of disease-carrying insects. In this paper we propose a modified Verhulst – logistic growth – equation with temperature-dependent parameters. Namely, the growth rate r and the carrying capacity K are given by thermodynamic functions of temperature T, r(T) and K(T). Our main concern is with the problem of learn-ing about unknown parameters of these deterministic functions from observations of population time series P(t,T). We propose a strategy to estimate parameters of r(T) and K(T) by treating the model output P(t,T) as a realization of a Gaussian process (GP) with fixed variance and mean function given by the analytic solution to the modified Verhulst equation. We then use Gibbs sampling, implemented using the recently developed rstan package of the R statistical computing environment, to approximate the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest. In order to eval-uate the performance of our algorithm, we run a Monte Carlo study on a simulated example, where bias and coverage were calculated. We then proceed to apply the ap-proach described herein to laboratory data of the Chagas disease vector, Rhodnius prolixus. Analysis of this data shows that the growth rate for the insect popula-tion under study achieves its maximum around 26 • C and the carrying capacity is maximum around 25 • C, suggesting that R. prolixus populations may thrive even in temperate climates.},

Logarithmic pooling is a popular method to aggregate expert opinions by using a set of weights that reflect the reliability of each information source. The resulting pooled distribution however heavily depends set of weights given to each opinion/prior. In this paper we explore three objective approaches to assigning weights to opinions. Two methods are stated in terms of optimization problems and a third one uses a hierarchical prior that accounts for uncertainty on the weights. We explore an example in which a proportion is estimated using weights assigned to a finite set of opinions and show that, depending on the used method, results vary from discarding some of the expert opinions to the situation in which all opinions are assigned equal weights. Nevertheless, the three methods explored in this paper lead to very similar combined priors, with very similar integrated (marginal) likelihoods.

  Abstract                 = {Background: Around 20-30{\%} of alcohol use in low and middle-income countries is estimated to come from unrecorded sources, but little is known about the characteristics of its consumers. The aim of this study was to obtain information about users of unrecorded alcohol and describe factors associated with its frequent use. Method: A cross-sectional study, using Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS), was conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2010. Individuals aged 18-65 who reported binge drinking in the last 12 months were recruited to participate in a structured interview. Three sources of unrecorded alcohol use were assessed: home-made/unrecorded; perfumes/lotions; and "medicinal" products (compounds made of herbs and local spirits). Results: 343 individuals were recruited and 303 were interviewed. The sample comprised mostly of men (n= 256) from low socioeconomic strata, with a mean age of 38.8 (??12). Most individuals (71.8{\%}) reported to have used more than one variety of unrecorded alcohol, which was found to be associated with: being older than 31 (OR 2.21; CI 95{\%} 1.05-4.80), an AUDIT score >20 (OR 11.21; CI 95{\%} 4.56-30.96), having used crack/cocaine (OR 2.29; CI 95{\%} 1.02-5.21), and having received treatment for alcohol addiction in the last 12 months (OR 3.64; CI 95{\%} 1.25-13.49). Conclusion: Most unrecorded alcohol users were disadvantaged polysubstance users. Assessing unrecorded alcohol use has important clinical implications and should be screened for among crack/powder cocaine and alcohol-dependent patients. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Diffuse astrocytic tumors are the most frequently occurring primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Their histological sub-classification into diffuse astrocytoma (DA), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) and glioblastoma (GB) is challenging and the available prognostic factors are limited to age and tumor subtype. Biomarkers that may improve the histological sub-classification and/or serve as prognostic factors are, therefore, urgently needed. The relationship between survivin and p53 in diffuse astrocytic tumor progression and survival is currently unclear. Here, we aimed to assess the relevance of these proteins in the accuracy of the histological sub-classification of these tumors and their respective treatment responses.},

The usual approach is to assume that the expert's knowledge can be adequately represented by a Dirichlet distribution, since this is by far the simplest multivariate distribution that is appropriate for such a set of proportions. It is also the most convenient, particularly when the expert's prior knowledge is to be combined with a multinomial sample since then the Dirichlet is the conjugate prior family. Several methods have been described in the literature for eliciting beliefs in the form of a Dirichlet distribution, which typically involve eliciting from the expert enough judgements to identify uniquely the Dirichlet hyperparameters. We describe here a new method which employs the device of over-fitting, i.e. eliciting more than the minimal number of judgements, in order to (a) produce a more carefully considered Dirichlet distribution and (b) ensure that the Dirichlet distribution is indeed a reasonable fit to the expert's knowledge. The method has been implemented in a software extension of the Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF) to facilitate the multivariate elicitation process.},
