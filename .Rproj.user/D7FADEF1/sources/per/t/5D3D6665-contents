My research spans statistical modeling, machine learning, and Bayesian methods applied to diverse domains, with a strong current focus on **Precision Medicine** and **Personalized Treatment Effect Prediction**. Below are the main fields that structure my work:

---

### **Machine Learning and Bayesian Methods for Precision Medicine**
I develop advanced statistical and machine learning methods to support personalized healthcare decisions. My work includes Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, meta-heuristic feature selection, and hybrid AI approaches for predicting individual treatment effects (PITE), particularly in clinical trials for alcohol use disorders.

- [A Bayesian Additive Regression Trees Model for Zero and One Inflated Data](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.19848v1)
- [Hybrid AI Methods for Feature Selection in Personalized Treatment Effect Prediction](https://pchiroque.github.io/files/WIDS_2025.pdf)
- [Vorhersage von individuellen Effekten (Predicting Individual Treatment Effects)](https://pchiroque.github.io/files/BAYSM2025.pdf)

---

### **Statistical Learning and Predictive Modeling**
I explore regression and tree-based models for complex outcome structures and constrained domains, aiming to improve predictive accuracy and interpretability.

- [Regression Based on Tree for Outcomes with Closed Boundary Domain](https://pchiroque.github.io/files/WIDS_poster_14May24_P.pdf)
- [Identifying Heterogeneity in Regression Compositional Data Integration with Many Categories (In Review)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2302.09541)

---

### **Machine Learning in Remote Sensing and Environmental Monitoring**
I apply probabilistic models and machine learning algorithms to predict vegetation and biomass using multispectral and LiDAR UAV data.

- [Predicting Biomass and LAI for Multispectral-LiDAR UAV-based Data](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/conferences/agstats2023/documents/Program%20Booklet%202023%20BAC11.pdf)
- [Mapping Leaf Area Index of Chestnut Trees using Multispectral UAV Data](https://doi.org/10.3390/drones6120422)

---

### **Bayesian and Hierarchical Models in Ecology and Climate Research**
I develop statistical models for ecological and climate data, including compositional regression and hierarchical approaches to understand species distribution and environmental interactions.

- [Precision and Accuracy of Common Coral Reef Sampling Protocols Revisited with Photogrammetry](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2023.106304)
- [Modeling Coral Growth Bands and Marine Community Dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150880)
- [Decadal Dynamics of Southwestern Atlantic’s Largest Turbid Zone Reefs](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247111)
- [Tropical Rhodolith Beds as Reef Fish Habitat](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80574-w)

### **Applied Statistical Modeling in Public Health and Epidemiology**
I have worked on Bayesian hierarchical models for disease surveillance and epidemic dynamics, as well as modeling COVID-19 vulnerability and protection indices.

- [Community Surveillance of COVID-19 using Wastewater Data] *(in collaboration)*
- [The Covid-19 Protection Index (CPI)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-24541-1_21)
- [COVID-19 Waves: Accumulative Mortality Analysis](https://doi.org/10.1620/tjem.251.47)

---

### **Statistical Methods for Risk and Insurance Models**
Earlier research focused on actuarial science, including collective risk models, heavy-tailed distributions, and Bayesian approaches for pricing and risk measures.

- [A Heavy-Tailed and Overdispersed Collective Risk Model](https://doi.org/10.1080/10920277.2021.1943451)

---

### **Multivariate and Compositional Data Analysis**
I have proposed methods for clustering and regression with compositional data, applied to wood properties, marine ecology, and other complex systems.

- [A Robust Clustering Method using Compositional Data Restrictions: Studying Wood Properties in Portugal](https://doi.org/10.26077/201b-56ee)
- [Identifying Heterogeneity in Regression Compositional Data Integration with Many Categories](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2302.09541)

### **Bibliometrics and Scientific Visibility**
Earlier work includes analyzing scientific impact and visibility through bibliometric methods.
