## Scientific Profile

I am a statistician dedicated to advancing **precision medicine** and **personalized healthcare** through the integration of **statistical learning**, **Bayesian modeling**, and **artificial intelligence**.  
My work focuses on developing interpretable models for predicting individual treatment effects, enabling more informed and individualized medical decision-making.

My research bridges **advanced statistical theory** with **modern machine learning paradigms** to address complex, real-world data challenges in health, ecology, and environmental monitoring.

These challenges include missing data, time-to-event and longitudinal structures, and non-Gaussian response distributions such as categorical, discrete, or inflated outcomes.

With more than 18 years of continuous research and academic experience, my expertise includes:

- **Advanced Statistical Modeling** – longitudinal data analysis, survival models, time-varying coefficients  
- **Machine Learning & AI** – predictive modeling, meta-heuristic feature selection, explainable AI  
- **Bayesian Inference & Dynamic & Hierarchical Models** – uncertainty quantification and multi-level data integration  
- **Applied Domains** – precision medicine, environmental monitoring, and epidemiology.
