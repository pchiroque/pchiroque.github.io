Hello! 

I am Pamela Solano, a statistician and researcher at the Faculty of Informatics and Data Science, University of Regensburg. 

I am currently focused on advancing precision medicine by developing techniques grounded in artificial intelligence and machine learning paradigms.

My primary interest lies in developing statistical tools to address real-world problems. Over the past 18 years, I have continuously refined my expertise in advanced statistical modeling, machine learning techniques, longitudinal data analysis, survival models, and time-varying coefficients. In recent years, I have also focused on machine learning and artificial intelligence paradigms.
