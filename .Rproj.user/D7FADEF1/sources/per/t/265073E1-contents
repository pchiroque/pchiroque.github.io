## üéì Overview

My research integrates **advanced statistical modeling** and **machine learning** to address complex problems in **precision medicine**, **epidemiology**, **ecology**, and **environmental science**.  
I develop interpretable **Bayesian and probabilistic frameworks** for heterogeneous, high-dimensional, and bounded data ‚Äî always seeking a balance between **methodological innovation** and **real-world impact**.  

<!-- Beyond scientific contributions, I am deeply committed to **Science Communication and Public Engagement**, promoting accessibility and trust in research, particularly within **Latin American contexts** where science often faces undervaluation.   -->
